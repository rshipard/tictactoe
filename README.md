# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a game designed as my first project within the GA Software Immersive Flex Program.

The game itself needs little introduction, the rules are included as part of the website. Instead I thought if anyone wanted to see my reasoning and why I've chosen certain methods this would be the best place to properly explain why I've chosen what I have.

I will be comming back to this document and updating it over time, however please don't expect it to be kept updated exactly with any changes I have made. Indeed this may be a good snapshot of one way I tried to to this project.
