# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a game designed as my first project within the GA Software Immersive Flex Program.

My initial thoughts were to create only a few variables, and then to use nested functions to small blocks of code that I could test individually, then bring them together within a few larger functions that would be called as people clicked on the individual cells fo the game.

I was trying to look for ways to make the game scaleable, but I decided early on that could take a backseat to getting the code done quickly. My reasoning being it's better to have code that works, and that I can easily bug test, than to do something that scale wells but I won't know if it  works until much later.

Too late I realised that the planning stages are quite possible the most important. If you push something off, or miss it entirely the time spent having to redesign or re-engineer can end up costing you hours for what should have been a 2 minute dot point in your planning.

Case in point - scaleability. If I'd factored that in early and focused on it I would have written this code completely differently.
