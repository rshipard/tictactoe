# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a game designed as my first project within the GA Software Immersive Flex Program.

My initial thoughts were to create only a few variables and then to use nested functions to small blocks of code that I could test individually, then bring them together within a few larger functions that would be called as people clicked on the individual cells fo the game.

I was trying to look for ways to make the game scaleable, but I decided early on that could take a backseat to getting the code done quickly. My thoughts being it's better ot have code that works, that is easily bug tested, than to do something that scale wells but I won't know works until much later.
